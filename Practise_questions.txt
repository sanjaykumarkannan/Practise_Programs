1.Given a String with or without special characters find if it is Palindrome or Not.. No splitting of array must be done or No additional spaces must be used for storing the array..

Eg: RACE CAR

Eg: I DID, DID I ?

2. Given an array of integers of size n. Convert the array in such a way that if next valid number is same as current number, double its value and replace the next number with 0. 
After the modification, rearrange the array such that all 0’s are shifted to the end.

7. Given a text and a wildcard pattern, implement wildcard pattern matching algorithm that finds if wildcard pattern is matched with text. The matching should cover the entire text (not partial text).
 

The wildcard pattern can include the characters ‘?’ and ‘*’
‘?’ – matches any single character
‘*’ – Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence)

8. Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.

Consider the following dictionary

  cream, icecream, man, go, mango}

Input:  ilike
Output: Yes 
The string can be segmented as "i like".

Input:  ilikesamsung
Output: Yes
The string can be segmented as "i like samsung" 
or "i like sam sung".<>

9.Print the following pattern

   1  
  3 2
 6 5 4
10 9 8 7
10 9 8 7 
 6 5 4 
  3 2 
   1

10.Given an array as input, The condition is if the number is repeated you must add the number and put the next index value to 0. If the number is 0 print it at the last.
 

Eg: arr[] = { 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8}
Output: 4 2 12 8 0 0 0 0 0 .

11.Given two dimensional matrix of integer and print the rectangle can be formed using given indices and also find the sum of the elements in the rectangle
Input: mat[M][N] = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {5, 3, 8, 1, 2}, {4, 6, 7, 5, 5}, {2, 4, 8, 9, 4} };
index = (2, 0) and (3, 4)
Output:
Rectangle
4 6 7 5 5
2 4 8 9 4
sum 54
 

12. Find the result subtraction, multiplication, division of two integers using + operator.
Input: 6 and 4
output:
addition 6+4 = 10,    subtraction  6+(-4) = 2,   multiplication = 24,   division = 1

Input : -8 and -4
Output:
addition -8+(-4) = -12,    subtraction  (-8)+(-(-4)) = -4,   multiplication = 32,   division = 2

 

13.Given a sentence of string, in that remove the palindrome words and print the remaining.
Input:
He did a good deed
Output:
He good

Input:
Hari speaks malayalam
Output:
Hari speaks

14.Given two dates, find total number of days between them.

Input: dt1 = {10, 2, 2014} dt2 = {10, 3, 2015}
Output: 393

dt1 represents “10-Feb-2014” and dt2 represents “10-Mar-2015” The difference is 365 + 28

Input: dt1 = {10, 2, 2000} dt2 = {10, 3, 2000}
Output: 29

Note that 2000 is a leap year

Input: dt1 = {10, 2, 2000} dt2 = {10, 2, 2000}
Output: 0

Both dates are same

Input: dt1 = {1, 2, 2000}; dt2 = {1, 2, 2004};
Output: 1461

Number of days is 365*4 + 1

 
15.

Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence.

Examples:

Input: digits[] = “121”
Output: 3 // The possible decodings are “ABA”, “AU”, “LA”

Input: digits[] = “1234” Output: 3

// The possible decodings are “ABCD”, “LCD”, “AWD”

This was a hands-on coding round with 8 questions.
You could use C, C++ or JAVA

Most of the questions were easy:

Given 4 integers as input. Find whether they would form a rectangle, square or none.
Insert an element at a particular index in an array.

Some were average:

Given a large number convert it to the base 7.
Given an IP address validate it based on the given conditions.
Sort parts of an array separately using peak values.

Some were a bit challenging:

Given an input array, find the number of occurrences of a particular number without looping (use hashing)
Diamond pattern printing based on some conditions
Given an array of characters print the characters that have ‘n’ number of occurrences. If a character appears consecutively it is counted as 1 occurrence
Eg: a b a a b c c d e d
Here a has only 2 occurrences
